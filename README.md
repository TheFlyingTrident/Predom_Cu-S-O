1.Open the colab link or .py code provided in zip file using browser or appropiate python interpreter like PyCharm respectively.

2.For colab you may run each cell individually in order or run all cells at once.

3.The program will ask to input a temperature value in Kelvin for which you want to plot the predominance diagram .You may test the program results on random temperatures like 
1000K,1100K,1350.5K and so on.

4.The output will contain a labelled predominance plot of Cu-S-O system including :

Red line segments - indicate that two phases lying on either side of the segment are in equilibrium with each other over the line. Hence, we can form equations of the lines (denoting conversion between the two phases), using the equilibrium constant values (derived from the gibbs free energy data). The equations have conversion between condensed phases along with O2 and SO2. Using the relation of equilibrium constant with pO2 and pSO2, we form the linear equations of the red line segments.

X-axis - denotes the log(pO2) values, where pO2 is the partial pressure of O2 at temperature T, and log values are to the base 10.
  
Y-axis - denotes the log(pSO2) values, where pSO2 is the partial pressure of SO2 at temperature T, and log values are to the base 10.

Labels - denotes the areas in which a particular condensed phase of Cu is stable at temperature T and at certain partial pressure values of O2 & SO2.The * label denotes a point at which three phases of Cu are in equilibrium with each other and also denotes the formation of Cu2SO4(s).
